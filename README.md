# Theorize: Data Analysis of Onchain Trading Activity

The Theorize library analyzes onchain trading activity indexed via the Graph protocol.

The main focus of this library is initially on **scouting**. It attempts to answer the following question:

```
What assets are now being accumulated by accounts that previously accumulated other specified assets during certain time periods?
```

This type of analysis can be helpful in identifying potential investment opportunities.

The library will be expanded to facilitate other types of analysis of onchain activity.

## Installation

Install with `python setup.py install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Run with `python theorize`. Use `python theorize -h` or `python theorize --help` for instructions on using the Theorize script.
